Comments:

- A cleaned version of the data for US commercial Banks (as described in the paper's appendix), is available in US_com_banks/csv_data/ 
- In the cleaning_code folder an old and unmaintained version of the matlab and gawk code used for cleaning is available
    - The GAWK code was used to parse raw csv files downloaded from https://www.chicagofed.org/banking/financial-institution-reports/commercial-bank-data. Unfortunately the code is commented in Italian.
    - The matlab files assume the data processed with gawk.
    - Overall the code is probably not usable. We keep it here just in case of an (unlikely) future effort to clean it and comment it.
