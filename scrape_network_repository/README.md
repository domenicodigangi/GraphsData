# Discrete Time Temporal Networks from Datasets at http://networkrepository.com/
Download datasets as graph streams (sequence of edges with timestamps) and format them into, uniformly spaced, discrete time temporal networks 

1. download_datasets.py - List all temporal networks datasets, download those that have some metadata and unzip them 
2. aggregate_graph_streams.py -
